# RL-Algs-Talk
Slides accompanying presentation given as part of CMPS 290C: Advanced Topics in Machine Learning on reinforcement learning algorithms and alternatives

The presentation is focused primarily on the following three papers:

[Playing Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~vmnih/docs/dqn.pdf)

[Evolution Strategies as a Scalable Alternative to Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.03864.pdf)

[Deep Neuroevolution: Genetic Algorithms are a Competitive Alternative for Training Deep Neural Networks for Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.06567.pdf)
